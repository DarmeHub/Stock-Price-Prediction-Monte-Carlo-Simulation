## Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task, and it often involves uncertainties due to market volatility. Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique that can help us model these uncertainties and provide insights into potential future price scenarios. This repository provides a practical example of how to use Monte Carlo simulation to predict MSFT stock prices and analyze their possible ranges.

## Dependencies
To run the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.X

yfinance

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scipy

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

'pip install yfinance numpy pandas matplotlib scipy'

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook file directly.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (see the Dependencies section).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook "Stock Price Prediction Model using Monte Carlo Simulation.ipynb" using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Notebook Overview
The "Stock Price Prediction Model using Monte Carlo Simulation.ipynb" notebook guides you through the process of building a stock price prediction model using Monte Carlo simulation. It covers the following key steps:

1. Importing necessary packages and extracting historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance.
2. Calculating historical log returns and statistical measures (mean, variance, and standard deviation).
3. Simulating future daily returns using random numbers and the normal distribution.
4. Simulating future prices with and without drift.
5. Quantifying worst, average, and best-case scenarios for future stock prices.
6. Establishing confidence intervals to assess the potential price range with different confidence levels.

## Usage
The notebook serves as a practical guide to creating a stock price prediction model using Monte Carlo simulation. You can run each code cell step by step to see the process and visualizations. Additionally, you can modify the parameters and adjust the simulation settings to suit your preferences.

Please note that stock price prediction models are subject to various uncertainties, and the results of simulations are not guaranteed to reflect actual market outcomes.
